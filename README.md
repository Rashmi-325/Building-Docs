# Building-Docs
A web-based resume/CV/cover letter builder that leverages machine learning to provide intelligent assistance. The application will help users create and analyze professional documents by offering features such as an AI content generator, grammatical error correction, and feedback on resume strength and completeness. 
It will also have some small but important features like downloading the document in PDF, JPG, PNG, etc formats. 
This project aims to solve a real-life problem by employing skills in both full-stack web development and the practical application of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning.
